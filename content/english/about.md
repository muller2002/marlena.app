Hi there, my name is Marlena (she/her), and I am a female CS-student who is currently in the process of graduating from the Paderborn University. Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in the student council, where I get to work with other students to improve the academic and social experiences of our fellow peers.

One of my greatest passions in the field of computer science is theoretical computer science. I find it incredibly fascinating to explore the mathematical foundations and theoretical principles that underpin computer science, and I love learning about the latest advancements and breakthroughs in this area.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also proud to be a member of the transgender community. Being trans has taught me a lot about self-discovery, resilience, and the power of authenticity. It has also given me a unique perspective on the world, which I believe makes me a better computer scientist, thinker, and problem solver.

Overall, I am a curious, ambitious, and open-minded individual who is passionate about making a positive impact in the world through my work in computer science. I am excited to see where my journey takes me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share a little bit about myself with you.
