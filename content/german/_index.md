I am a female CS-student who is passionate about theoretical computer science and actively involved in the student council at the Paderborn University. I am also proud to be a member of the transgender community, which has given me a unique perspective on the world and made me a better thinker and problem solver. If you want to know more about me, you can read my [CV](/cv/) or [about me](/about/) page.
